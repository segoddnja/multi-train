```

### Code Quality Tools

This project uses industry-standard tools to enforce code quality:

#### Prettier

- **Configuration**: `.prettierrc` with consistent formatting rules
- **Auto-formatting**: Formats code on save in supported IDEs
- **Pre-commit**: Automatically formats staged files

#### ESLint

- **Modern Config**: ESLint 9 with flat configuration format
- **TypeScript Support**: Full integration with TypeScript
- **React Rules**: Specialized rules for React development
- **Auto-fix**: Many issues can be automatically resolved

#### Husky + lint-staged

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Runs quality checks before each commit
- **Optimized**: Only processes staged files for faster execution
- **Quality Gate**: Prevents commits with formatting or linting issues

#### IDE Integration

- **VSCode**: Auto-formatting on save, extension recommendations
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Prettier integration and code style settings
- **Consistent Experience**: Same formatting across all development environments

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with fast HMR
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom animations
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback)
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint 9, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged
